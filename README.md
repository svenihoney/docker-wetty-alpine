Dockerized Wetty
================

This project has been archived, since the changes have been incorporated in the [wetty](https://github.com/butlerx/wetty) project itself. 
Please use the wetty containers instead of this one.

This is a dockerized version of Wetty butlerx (https://github.com/butlerx/wetty), 
with additional ideas from Robert Szymczak (https://github.com/m451/docker-wetty). Both docker images available in these
repositories are node base, with sized up to 1G. This one is based on alpine-node, which gives 
a docker image of around 30MB with all npm modules.

This project is linked to the docker hub, so you may always pull the latest build from any docker environment.

```
docker pull svenihoney/wetty
```

Then you can run the application using:

```
docker run -dt -e REMOTE_SSH_SERVER=10.10.10.10 -e REMOTE_SSH_PORT=22 -e REMOTE_SSH_USER=root -p 3000 --name term  svenihoney/wetty
```
The environment parameters 

- REMOTE_SSH_SERVER
- REMOTE_SSH_PORT
- REMOTE_SSH_USER
- WETTY_PORT

are optional and will be used to configure wetty. If not set, a connection to 127.0.0.1:22 using root will be performed.
In order to access the web application, you have to get the IP and PORT it is hosted at within your docker environment. 
You may use "docker ps" or "docker inspect" to get the informations. The following command will return the external PORT back the container is mapped back to you.

```
docker port term 3000
```

You may then access the application using http://DockerHostIP:PORT. You may dynamicly change the login-user by utilizing wetty's HTTP GET syntax, e.g.: 

```
http://DockerHostIP:PORT/ssh/your-ssh-user
```

Reverse Proxy
-------------

I recommend running the image behind a nginx proxy. Please have a look at https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy,
which is used by the included ![docker compose](docker-compose.yml) file.

SSH Keyfiles
-------------

You can set the following environmental variables to use SSH keyfiles:

- SSH_AUTH=publickey
- SSH_KEY=/path/to/key

Example:
```
docker run -dt -e REMOTE_SSH_SERVER=10.10.10.10 -e REMOTE_SSH_PORT=22 -e REMOTE_SSH_USER=root -p 3000 --name term  -e 'SSH_AUTH=publickey' -e 'SSH_KEY=/config/id_rsa' -v /path/to/key/id_rsa:/config/id_rsa:ro svenihoney/wetty
```

SSH Host Checking
-------------

You can enable strict host checking with the following options:

- `-e KNOWNHOSTS=/path/to/known/hosts`
- `-v /path/to/known/hosts:/path/to/known/hosts`


Example:
```
docker run -dt -e REMOTE_SSH_SERVER=10.10.10.10 -e REMOTE_SSH_PORT=22 -e REMOTE_SSH_USER=root -p 3000 --name term  -e 'KNOWNHOSTS=/config/known_hosts' -v '/path/to/known/hosts:/config/known_hosts' svenihoney/wetty
```
